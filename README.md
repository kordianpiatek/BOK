# BOK
Customer service office

The application has two roles: support and client
 * Logging in to the application
 * The customer can create a new thread (conversation) from BOK
 * On the support side, there is a system of assigning threads to each other
 * In a given thread, the client can exchange messages with support (they will not be exchanged live)

The application uses the Singleton and MVC pattern
